Above is my hourly day planner.
The hours range from 9am - 5pm.Depending on what time you use the planner, the planner will be a different colour any hours pasted will be highlighted in grey, any hours in the future will be displayed in green and the current hour will be coloured in red.

In my planner you can save tasks you need to do and close the application down, when the application is reopened the tasks will still be present.

You do have a live timer on the page so you know what time it is.
